## Demo
Deployment - Made the flask app just add the procfile and requirements.txt to deploy using heroku. [How to deploy](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deploy-python-flask-app-on-heroku/)

## Overview
This is a Flask web app which predicts the car name provided the car picture.

The model used was Resnet50 with fine tuing .Resnet50 and VGG models were used and Resnet came out to perform better

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.9.1. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). <br/>
Make sure that pip is upgraded if not:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```
- Cloning the repository :
     - ðŸ¦– go to the folder in your device where you want to clone <br/>
     - ðŸ¦– make sure that git is installed already if not click [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amey16/Flight-fare-prediction.git
```
. If there is a slice error while running the code read the following points-
     . tensorflow.keras was depreciated to keras 
     . In order to run this particular model you need to have tenserflow.keras only
     . ```pip install tensorflow``` - specify version 2.0 if neccessary

## Deployement on Heroku
Login or signup in order to create virtual app. You can either connect your github profile or download ctl to manually deploy this project.

Click on the create app option once you reach this page
<br/>
Follow the instruction given on [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) to deploy a web app.


## Dataset

The dataset was made using web scraping of google images using the request and Beautiful_soup libraries <br/>
To know more about how i actually did web scraping [click here](https://github.com/amey16/Image-Web-Scraper) <br/>
<br/>
The dataset was collected for six cars namely mercedes , ferrari , bmw , lamborghini , tesla ,audi <br/>
How the images look after web scraped -<br/>

<br/>
The testset was made manually by transfering some images from trainset

## Additional points
- Make sure that you have an empty uploads floder before you run the app
- If you want to install all libraries required for this project run these commands
    - pip install pipreqs
    - pipreqs "folder path"
- You can also try using VGG16 model it performs good on image datasets
## Future Scope

* Experiment aroud different architectures in transfer learning
* Improve the prediction accuracy then optimize Flask app.py and improve the UI
